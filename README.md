# Traderie Search QOL

This tool enhances the Traderie website's search functionality by allowing users to filter item listings based on affix values (e.g., Resistances, Life, Mana) directly within the URL.

   - Toggle the "Developer mode" switch in the top-right corner.

3. **Load the Script**:
   - Click on "Load unpacked" and select the folder where you downloaded or extracted the script files.

4. **Visit Traderie**:

## How It Works

1. **Navigate to the Item Page**:
   - Use Traderieâ€™s search bar at the top of the page.
   - Search for an item (e.g., "Grand Charm").
   - Click on the desired item to go to its specific product page (e.g., [Grand Charm Page](https://traderie.com/diablo2resurrected/product/3779798752)).

2. **Enter Desired Affix Values**:
   - In the tool's sidebar, input the desired number (e.g., 10) for each affix you want to filter by (e.g., Life, Resistances, Mana).

3. **Select Affixes**:
   - Click on the buttons for the affixes (e.g., "All Resistances", "Life", "Mana", etc.) that you want to apply to your search. This action will instantly update the URL to reflect the selected affix values.

4. **Update the URL**:
   - After clicking the affix buttons, the URL will automatically update without refreshing the page.
   - To apply the changes, click on the URL bar in your browser and press Enter. This will reload the page with the updated affix filter parameters.
   - **Note**: Refreshing the page will reset the filters. A reset button will be added in a future update.
